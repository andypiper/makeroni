## The Makeroni Website

This is the Makeroni website, at https://makeroni.cc

At the moment, this repository also has a wiki attached, for any community content we decide to track (and also for the Grand Plan).

## Up-and-running

Download and [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (and Go).

Clone this repository (shout-out to the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli), it is reeeeally nice)

On a Mac you can do most of the install work using Homebrew (Hugo pulls in Go)

```sh
brew install hugo
brew install gh
```

Run `hugo server -D` to run the development server locally.

### Warning

‼️ *Committing to the main branch will automatically deploy to Netlify*

If you are making changes, branch and/or fork and work in a branch.
