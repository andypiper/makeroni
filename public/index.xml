      <description>DJ reviews the TS80P Soldering Iron
I&amp;rsquo;ve been through most of the TS range of soldering irons, the original TS100 was a solid performer, mostly limited by its power supply. The OLED display and the microcontroller driven internals offered up so many possibilities for smarter soldering. Many of which would be unrealised until folks started hacking their own firmware for the device. It was super compact though and created a new space for compact smart soldering irons for the maker toolbag.</description>

      <description>Marian reviews the Smart Power Back Keep Alive
I bought this one, and am very pleased with it. Does what it says it does. It also comes with a note which explains there&amp;rsquo;s a screw on the device which acts as a potentiometer so that you can adjust the current to the absolute lowest you need. For under a tenner, great!

      <description>As HackWimbledon, we had 16 Saturday meetups online and we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to stop.
  Makeroni meetups happen on video and audio on Discord ever Saturday from 12 midday to 4pm.
  You&amp;rsquo;re always welcome to chat at anytime in the Discord channels, but in these four hours we want the meeting to be more meetupy - face to face, talking about what we&amp;rsquo;re making, showing it, and helping each other make it better.</description>

      <title>Makeroni Is Live</title>

      <description>Now you may wonder what Makeroni is, so here&amp;rsquo;s some brief history. HackWimbledon, the popup makerspace in Wimbledon, operating out of Wimbletech, has been going for a six years or so when Covid-19 struck.
This made things hard - the group was all about meeting up in person. HackWimbledon adjourned to an online presence with the aim on maybe meeting up again when this thing was over. It&amp;rsquo;s now July, Covid-19 will be with us for quite a while and HackWimbledon had to evolve to meet the new challenge of how to be a community.</description>
