      <description>Marian reviews the Smart Power Back Keep Alive
I bought this one, and am very pleased with it. Does what it says it does. It also comes with a note which explains there&amp;rsquo;s a screw on the device which acts as a potentiometer so that you can adjust the current to the absolute lowest you need. For under a tenner, great!

      <description>Now you may wonder what Makeroni is, so here&amp;rsquo;s some brief history. HackWimbledon, the popup makerspace in Wimbledon, operating out of Wimbletech, has been going for a six years or so when Covid-19 struck.
This made things hard - the group was all about meeting up in person. HackWimbledon adjourned to an online presence with the aim on maybe meeting up again when this thing was over. It&amp;rsquo;s now July, Covid-19 will be with us for quite a while and HackWimbledon had to evolve to meet the new challenge of how to be a community.</description>
