      <description>Marian reviews the Smart Power Back Keep Alive
I bought this one, and am very pleased with it. Does what it says it does. It also comes with a note which explains there&amp;rsquo;s a screw on the device which acts as a potentiometer so that you can adjust the current to the absolute lowest you need. For under a tenner, great!
