      <description>As HackWimbledon, we had 16 Saturday meetups online and we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to stop.
  Makeroni meetups happen on video and audio on Discord ever Saturday from 12 midday to 4pm.
  You&amp;rsquo;re always welcome to chat at anytime in the Discord channels, but in these four hours we want to be meeting be more meetupy - face to face, talking about what we&amp;rsquo;re making, showing it, and helping each other make it better.</description>

      <description>Now you may wonder what Makeroni is, so here&amp;rsquo;s some brief history. HackWimbledon, the popup makerspace in Wimbledon, operating out of Wimbletech, has been going for a six years or so when Covid-19 struck.
This made things hard - the group was all about meeting up in person. HackWimbledon adjourned to an online presence with the aim on maybe meeting up again when this thing was over. It&amp;rsquo;s now July, Covid-19 will be with us for quite a while and HackWimbledon had to evolve to meet the new challenge of how to be a community.</description>
