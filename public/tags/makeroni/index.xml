      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re still here, meeting every Saturday afternoon for hours of project building, chats and more. We&amp;rsquo;re also having occasional meetups in the flesh, down the pub and there&amp;rsquo;s still some work happening on putting together a smarter site with project tracking and micromeetups.
What do we cover these days? Well, recent discussions have centered around Home Assistant, MQTT, Zigbee, ESP-Home and all the nuances of getting home automation working. There&amp;rsquo;s also been hacking on Python, MicroPython, CircuitPython, TinyGo and lots of small boards, watches and things that look like tiny game consoles.</description>

      <description>You may, or may not, be wondering how Makeroni has been going since we went online-only for the pandemic. Well, as the solstice comes about, we&amp;rsquo;re going great with our regular Saturday meetups carrying on in an unbroken sequence and occasional Makeroni extra sessions popping up on demand.
There&amp;rsquo;s less robots at the moment (they really benefit from doing things in person), but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more Home Assistant building and installing as makers have had time to set up their own automated environs.</description>

      <description>As HackWimbledon, we had 16 Saturday meetups online and we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to stop.
  Makeroni meetups happen on video and audio on Discord ever Saturday from 12 midday to 4pm.
  You&amp;rsquo;re always welcome to chat at anytime in the Discord channels, but in these four hours we want the meeting to be more meetupy - face to face, talking about what we&amp;rsquo;re making, showing it, and helping each other make it better.</description>

      <title>Makeroni Is Live</title>

      <description>Now you may wonder what Makeroni is, so here&amp;rsquo;s some brief history. HackWimbledon, the popup makerspace in Wimbledon, operating out of Wimbletech, has been going for a six years or so when Covid-19 struck.
This made things hard - the group was all about meeting up in person. HackWimbledon adjourned to an online presence with the aim on maybe meeting up again when this thing was over. It&amp;rsquo;s now July, Covid-19 will be with us for quite a while and HackWimbledon had to evolve to meet the new challenge of how to be a community.</description>
