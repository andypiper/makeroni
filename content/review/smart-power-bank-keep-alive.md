Marian reviews the [Smart Power Back Keep Alive](https://www.tindie.com/products/overz/smart-power-bank-keep-alive/)

I bought this one, and am very pleased with it.  Does what it says it does.  It also comes with a note which explains there's a screw on the device which acts as a potentiometer so that you can adjust the current to the absolute lowest you need.  For under a tenner, great!
