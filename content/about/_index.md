## What is Makeroni?

Makeroni is still in a prototype phase. If you want to participate in realtime you'll find us all over on Discord on the [Makeroni](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) server. There we'll have Discord's fine community interaction tools available to us.

Our social media presence will be in Twitter for now as [@Makeronicc](https://twitter.com/MakeroniCC).

We'll continue to meetup online, every Saturday from 12 till 4 (UK local time) on Discord with video and audio in play for folks to talk and show and make, create and illuminate.

And finally the website, [Makeroni.cc](https://makeroni.cc), where you are right now, will be the base for a community contributed blog, and the launchpad for our longer term plans.

## What will Makeroni be?

The plan is that we're going to build out the web site to enable users to sign up as Makeroni members, complete with a location and as the conditions change, the site will enable groups of local makers (or visiting makers) to meetup and compare notes, hack devices and the like in a Covid-safe environment. So, that's the plan and if you want to join in making it real, welcome aboard.
