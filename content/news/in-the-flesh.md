# We're back in the flesh!

**TL;DR: Makeroni/HackWimbledon - March 20th - 12 till 4pm at Wimbletech.**

## Why now?

With the steady ramp down to zero of restrictions, HackWimbledon's old digs, at [Wimbletech](https://wimbletech.com), are now available to use again. So we're going to start having in-the-flesh meetings once a month. We're swapping out the Makeroni Talk event for the physical meetings.

## Back at Wimbletech

There's a fine revamped room for folks to interact in, which is well ventilated and now comes with a cracking big screen for showing folks how stuff works and complementing talks with visuals.

We will be starting out with a lot less/none of our pre-covid tooling, so if you want to build, bring your own soldering iron and so on. We'll work out how to organise and manage desks on the day, but there's the old HackWimbledon spirit to tap into (apparently I left a bottle of it there).

Oh and if anyone has any ideas on how we can let online folks see whats going on during the physical event, we're all ears. But enough about that accident with the teleporter...

## Safety First

Please remember to be safe anyway. Ideally, you'll be double or triple vaxxed (remember your host is on the critically vulnerable list and its true, I am very vulnerable to criticism...) and if you've got an LFT to hand, give yourself a quick check before hand - Covid's still out there and its only sensible to mitigate risks as best we can.

And that safety thing covers any tools you bring along and no making death rays (you'll know if thats addressing you in particular).

## Ready to Roll

So that's the plan. We don't have a Meetup yet, this is pretty much a soft relaunch. We're keeping the name Makeroni for the virtual community and as an umbrella for the physical events. If you need more information, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) and we will all be there ready to answer your questions, about HackWimbledon, Makeroni or hey, making things!
