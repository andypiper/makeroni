As HackWimbledon, we had 16 Saturday meetups online and we aren't going to stop.

* Makeroni meetups happen on video and audio on Discord every Saturday from 12 midday to 4pm.

* You're always welcome to chat at anytime in the Discord channels, but in these four hours we want the meeting to be more meetupy - face to face, talking about what we're making, showing it, and helping each other make it better.

**So** - if you aren't on Discord yet, use this [link](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) to get online and invited to the Makeroni server and we'll see you there!
