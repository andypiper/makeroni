We're still here, meeting every Saturday afternoon for hours of project building, chats and more. We're also having occasional meetups in the flesh, down the pub and there's still some work happening on putting together a smarter site with project tracking and micromeetups.

What do we cover these days? Well, recent discussions have centered around Home Assistant, MQTT, Zigbee, ESP-Home and all the nuances of getting home automation working. There's also been hacking on Python, MicroPython, CircuitPython, TinyGo and lots of small boards, watches and things that look like tiny game consoles.

And if your plans are bigger, we've got a resident cloud builder in house so you can make apps in the ether. If you aren't into this, really do come along and bring your favorite subject with you!

So as always, you can come along or just hang out on our Discord server, where we have searchable chat rooms, audio and video streaming, and now a handy events system which we're using to announce events into next year.
