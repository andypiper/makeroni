Makeroni's now on Mastodon, the un-Twitter messaging platform as @makeroni@fosstodon.org. This comes after a cracking talk from Andy Piper about distributed messaging systems - the notes are on the [wiki](https://github.com/makeronicc/makeroni/wiki/All-about-Mastodon) and the talk served as a great kick off for attendees to move away from the topically controversial site.

Also, did you know we are scheduling on Meetup now? No? You'll find all the activity on the [Meetup Makeroni Page](https://www.meetup.com/makeroni/). If you fancy coming along, just sign up and rsvp to a regular meeting.

On this site, new share icons and links have been added to get you zooming around Makeroni world quicker.

So come and meet us on Discord, check out the work over on Github, follow our Mastodon and Twitter presences and get involved!
