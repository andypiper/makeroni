**tl;dr: Makeroni/HackWimbledon - August 20th - 12 until 4pm at South Park Gardens.**

A couple of months ago, one of the group suggested that instead of our regular meetup at Wimbletech, we should *take advantage of the lovely summer weather* (!!) and do an outdoors meetup in a local park. So, we did! Now we're going to do it again, and this time, hold a show-and-tell and invite anyone to come and talk to us about what we make and do.

So here it is: Hack in the Park! We will be in South Park Gardens at the Pavilion between 12 and 4 in the afternoon on Sunday, August 20th. There's no specific need to [register on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/makeroni/events/292468375/) - but, if you do, we might have more of an idea of who you are, and you'll be able to stay in touch for future meetups.

Here is a handy map of where South Park Gardens is located (you can also find this on the meetup page). There's a nice cafe called [Bliss in the Park](https://www.facebook.com/blissinthepark/), and we will be right next to that. We would love to show you what we've been hacking on lately.

Feel free to [drop by our Discord](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu) in the meantime. Looking forward to saying hello on August 20th!
